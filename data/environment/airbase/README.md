AirBase data for Cologne Stations
=================================

This folder contains air quality measures taken from the European Union database called "AirBase".

The measurement data has been collected at ~20 different locations which are described in the file "stations.csv".

For each station, one CSV file of measurements is contained, named using the station ID. Unfortunately, the data for most stations is several years old or very spotty.
